New stuff
- Can put start conditions on work orders (by amount of resources or dependence on other work orders)
- Can create work order from profile which is tied to specific workshop
- Can set maximum number of general work orders per shop or disallow them by profession or altogether (note: this won't work for active old-save jobs)
- Repeatable work orders, ability to set restart frequencies

Other bug fixes/tweaks
- Allowed some site-wide occupations for dwarves
- Made paper slurries stockpile-able (won't work without updated raws)
