#Complex Installation Instructions (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------
1. Copy 16x16_sm.png from the unzipped data/art directory to your Dwarf Fortress data/art directory.
2. From your Dwarf Fortress directory open the data/init/init.txt in your favorite text editor and change the following values to:
  - FONT:16x16_sm.png
  - FULLFONT:16x16_sm.png

...and if you are using a graphics pack:
  - GRAPHICS_FONT:16x16_sm.png
  - GRAPHICS_FULLFONT:16x16_sm.png

You don't have to make these, but I also recommend changing the following values in your data/init/d_init.txt file:
  - SKY:250:8:0:0
  - PILLAR_TILE:10
  - TREE_TRUNK_PILLAR:10
  - TREE_TRUNK_PILLAR_DEAD:10
  - TREE_CAP_PILLAR:10
  - TREE_CAP_PILLAR_DEAD:10

You are also welcome to use my recommended color scheme by copying the unzipped data/init/color.txt to your Dwarf Fortress counterpart, after making the appropriate backups of course.

#Easy Installation Instructions (Not recommended)
------------------------------------------------
*Note: By doing this method you will set your Dwarf Fortress settings to the Simple Mood preconfigured settings, causing you to lose any changes you may have made to your d_init.txt, init.txt, and colors.txt. If you don't mind losing those changes or you are already at the default settings then by all means use this method for installation.

1. Copy the data file to your DF directory.
2. Play Dwarf Fortress!
